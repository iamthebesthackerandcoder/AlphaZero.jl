# Forty-Move Rule Removal Summary

## Overview
The forty-move rule has been successfully removed from the checkers implementation. This rule previously declared a draw if 40 moves passed without a capture or man move.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Implementation (game.jl)
- **Removed**: `is_forty_move_rule()` function
- **Kept**: `halfmove_clock` field in `CheckersEnv` for move tracking
- **Kept**: Halfmove clock increment/reset logic in `apply!()` function
- **Updated**: `determine_winner()` function no longer checks forty-move rule
- **Added**: Comment "# Forty-move rule removed" at line 205

### 2. Test Files Updated
- **test_draw_simple.jl**: Removed `test_forty_move_rule()` function
- **test_draw_conditions.jl**: 
  - Removed `test_forty_move_rule()` function
  - Removed `test_forty_move_sequence()` function  
  - Updated `run_all_tests()` to exclude forty-move rule tests

### 3. Code Cleanup
- **Types.jl**: Removed duplicate `Move` struct definition to fix method conflicts
- **Added**: `test_forty_move_removal.jl` verification script

## What Still Works

### ✅ Retained Functionality
- **Halfmove Clock Tracking**: Still increments for king-only moves, resets for captures/man moves
- **Threefold Repetition**: Draw rule still enforced correctly
- **Position History**: Still tracked for repetition detection
- **Move Undo/Redo**: Halfmove clock properly restored on undo
- **All Other Game Rules**: Captures, promotions, legal moves, etc.

### ❌ Removed Functionality
- **Forty-Move Draw Rule**: Games no longer end in draw after 40 moves without capture/man move
- **is_forty_move_rule() Function**: No longer exists

## Impact

### Positive Changes
- **Longer Games**: Games can continue indefinitely without artificial draw limits
- **More Natural Endgames**: King vs king endgames can play out fully
- **Cleaner Code**: Removed unused draw condition logic
- **Better Training**: AlphaZero can learn longer-term strategies

### Considerations
- **Potential Infinite Games**: Very rare king vs king positions might continue indefinitely
- **Training Time**: Longer games might increase training time slightly

## Verification

The removal has been verified through:
1. ✅ Function `is_forty_move_rule()` no longer exists
2. ✅ High halfmove_clock values (100+) don't cause game termination
3. ✅ Threefold repetition still works correctly
4. ✅ Halfmove clock still tracked for move counting
5. ✅ No method definition conflicts

## Configuration

The `draw_moves = 50` parameter in `Config.toml` is unrelated to the forty-move rule and remains for training configuration purposes.

## Conclusion

The forty-move rule has been cleanly removed while preserving all other checkers functionality. The implementation now focuses on the more standard threefold repetition draw rule, allowing for more natural game conclusions.
